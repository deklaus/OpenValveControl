# OpenValveControl
Low cost smart control for motorized 3 V floor heating valve actuators (like HmIP VdMOT and others) with web interface.
The web interface (ESP-ValveControl) uses an ESP8266 D1-mini and the motor control (PIC-ValveControl) uses a PIC18F16Q41.
All components are low cost and pluggable.

# Purpose
The heating control of our home regulates the supply temperature by means of two characteristic curves (slope and offset). 
This works reasonably well in most weather situations. However, if we shut down one room (e.g. the visitor room), the 
characteristic curves are no longer correct. And because our heating only knows whole degrees, it is not possible 
to adjust the temperature by half a degree. So far, we've turned the valves until it was reasonably right again.
To automate these settings, we would like to be able to vary one or more heating circuits via WiFi or a SmartHome interface.
Since our floor valves are on two storeys, we feel that the costs of two Homematic FALMOT (or equivalent clones) are too 
high for this purpose and the documentation is not detailed enough in most cases.
Since I am interested in the whole topic, I started to develop my own solution for this task and make it available 
to the community as an OpenSource project.
