# OpenValveControl
Low cost controller for motorized floor heating actuators (like VdMOT and similar)

# Purpose
Our heating control regulates the supply temperature by means of two characteristic curves (slope and offset). 
This works reasonably well in steady state. However, if we shut down one room (e.g. the visitor room), the 
characteristic curves are no longer correct. And because our heating only knows whole degrees, it is not possible 
to adjust the temperature by half a degree. So far, we've turned the valves until it was reasonably right again.
To automate these settings, we would like to be able to vary one or more heating circuits via WLAN or a SmartHome interface.
Since our floor valves are on two floors, we feel that the cost of two Homematic FALMOT (or equivalent clones) 
is too high for this purpose and the documentation is not detailed enough in most cases.
Since I am interested in the whole topic, I started to develop my own solution for the task and make it available 
to the community as an OpenSource project.
